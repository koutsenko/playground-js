This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Goal

This snippet project's aim is to see how react-virtualized and his successor react-window works.<br />
See the last deployed demo here: [https://koutsenko.github.io/snippet-react-virtualized/](https://koutsenko.github.io/snippet-react-virtualized/).<br />
Code is based on official demos available [here](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
